// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

(Your pseudocode here)

Decimal a;
Decimal b;
Decimal sum = a + b;
Console.WriteLine(sum);

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Your pseudocode here)

Int a;
If ( a % 2 =0)
{
	Console.WriteLine(" a is even" )
}
Else
{
	Console.WriteLine("a is odd")
}
//is this too much like regular code to be pseudocode? 

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)


// this will be much more like pseudocode because I don't know how to do this for real
input(a, b, c, d, e);
Int myArray[] = [a, b, c, d, e];
Decimal myArrayAvg = (a + b + c + d + e) / 5;
Int myArrayMin = myArray.min();
Int myArrayMax = myArray.max();
Console.WriteLine("The average of the numbers is " + myArrayAvg);
Console.WriteLine($"The Max of the numbers is {myArrayMax}, and the Min is {myArrayMin}");
